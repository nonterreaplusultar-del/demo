近期去了陕南游玩了两天，主要是游山玩水，相当一个闲云野鹤，好不自在！但是快乐的时间总是短暂的，我们第一天吃了吃火锅，第二天在太白县城吃了些饭菜就回家了。
小县城也有小县城的好，节奏慢，人少，基本没啥事情，感觉一万年都是一个样子。多少人穷其一生所追求的不过是那个样子。可叹世人无知，疯狂追求所谓的成功，可到头来幸福感比不过小县城里面的人，不如人家平淡一生，自己在大城市里打拼，外人看来是都是精英，可只有自己知道自己是多么牛马，外表光鲜，内在还是靠自己劳动赚钱的人，和那些大资本家躺着就赚钱的境界是玩玩不能比的，有时候人就这样，得不到的永远在悸动，渴望，无限美化自己没有走过的那条路，殊不知，自己有的是走了另外一条路的自己多么羡慕的。可笑可叹。
>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

>I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence;
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I－
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.

平淡的生活有时候也不错。自己努力了这麽多年突然觉得不值得，自己的付出和可能的回报不成正比，倒不如去摆烂来得逍遥自在。不过，有些事是无法由我自己决定的，只能走走看看了。
